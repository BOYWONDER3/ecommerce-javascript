## This is a fully functioning e-commerce website built with plain vanilla JS, that allows users to download products and purchase products using stripe without any database 
# For this application to work I'm going to need to have a client and server, the server handles all the payment info while the client is going to communicate to the server i.e sending an email, purchasing and downloading of courses.
# All my payments are going to be integrated with stripe
# I'm also going to use an API called SendInBlue that will handle all our email back and forth
# Alao implementing a passwordless login so we can login with just an email address which will be secure.
